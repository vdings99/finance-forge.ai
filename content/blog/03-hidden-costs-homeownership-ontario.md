First-time homebuyers in Ontario often focus solely on the purchase price and mortgage payments, but the true cost of homeownership extends much further. Land transfer tax in Ontario ranges from 0.5% to 2.5% of the purchase price, and Toronto residents pay an additional municipal land transfer tax. Annual property taxes average 1-1.5% of assessed value. Home insurance typically runs $1,200-$2,500 annually. Budget 1-3% of your home's value yearly for maintenance and repairs. Don't forget utility costs, which can add $300-500 monthly. A $600,000 home could easily cost $3,500-4,500 monthly when all expenses are factored in.
