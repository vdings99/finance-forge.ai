Canadian REITs have been beaten down over the past two years due to rising interest rates, but the tide may be turning. Many quality REITs are trading at significant discounts to their net asset value (NAV), offering distribution yields of 5-8%. As the Bank of Canada continues its easing cycle, REITs stand to benefit from both lower borrowing costs and potential NAV appreciation. Industrial and residential REITs look particularly attractive given strong fundamentals in those sectors. However, office REITs remain risky due to the work-from-home trend. Always diversify across REIT types and consider holding them in registered accounts to shelter the income from taxes.
