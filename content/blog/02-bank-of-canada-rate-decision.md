The Bank of Canada's recent rate decision has significant implications for Canadian homeowners. Variable-rate mortgage holders will see immediate changes to their payments, while those with fixed rates approaching renewal should start planning now. With the overnight rate currently at 3.25%, borrowers renewing from the ultra-low rates of 2020-2021 may face payment increases of 30-50%. Consider stress-testing your budget at a higher rate and exploring options like extending your amortization period or making lump-sum payments before renewal to reduce the principal.
