The Canada Carbon Rebate (formerly Climate Action Incentive) provides quarterly payments to offset the federal carbon tax. For 2025, a family of four in Ontario receives approximately $1,120 annually. To maximize your rebate: file your tax return on time (even if you have no income), ensure your marital status is up to date with the CRA, claim all eligible dependents, and if you live in a rural area, check the box on your return for the 20% rural supplement. Single individuals and couples should ensure only one person claims shared dependents. Payments are issued in April, July, October, and January.
