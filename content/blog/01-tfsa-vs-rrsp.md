The decision between contributing to a TFSA or RRSP depends on several factors including your current marginal tax rate, expected retirement income, and financial goals. If your current tax rate is higher than your expected retirement tax rate, RRSPs generally provide more benefit. For those in lower tax brackets or saving for medium-term goals, TFSAs offer more flexibility. In 2025, the TFSA contribution limit is $7,000, while RRSP contributions are capped at 18% of previous year's earned income up to $32,490. Consider a balanced approach: maximize your RRSP to bring your taxable income to a lower bracket, then direct remaining savings to your TFSA.
