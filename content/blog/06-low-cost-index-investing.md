Canadian investors collectively pay some of the highest investment fees in the world, with average mutual fund MERs exceeding 2%. On a $500,000 portfolio over 25 years, the difference between a 2.2% MER mutual fund and a 0.2% MER index ETF could exceed $300,000. Getting started with low-cost investing is simpler than ever: all-in-one ETFs like VBAL, VGRO, or XGRO provide globally diversified portfolios in a single ticker with MERs around 0.20-0.25%. Open a self-directed account at a discount brokerage, set up automatic contributions, and invest in one of these ETFs. No stock picking, no market timing — just consistent, low-cost investing over time.
